          <h2>The Challenge: What Our Client Needs</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Big Beast Brews & Beverages is an award winning micro brewery
              looking to launch its latest product, Belligerent Badger Brew.
            </li>
            <li>
              The client is looking to create a new landing page for their
              product that will include updates from their launch campain,
              special offers, contests and social network “challenges”. The
              client would also like an informative product page, including
              video and reviews.
            </li>
            <li>
              The client would like the product page to be evergreen. the goal
              of the landing page is to become a hub to focus the entire
              campaign concept. The client would hopes that it will become an
              online hangout were people can socialize and have fun.
            </li>
            <li>
              The client has cited movies such as “Animal House”, “Old School”
              and “Super Bad”.

          <h2>Our Proposed Solution</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We propose an interactive page, that will include al of the
              features specified by the client.
            </li>
            <li>
              To add greater levels of interactivity, we propose 3 games that
              could appear (or using a link to off site games) these games
              should appeal bar/pub culture, drinking games, and all must
              feature the badger character in some way.
            </li>
            <li>
              For this it be aesthetically alluring and practical, we suggest
              outsourcing the design of the badger character and animation to an
              animatore that has worked with us on several projects. We would
              also like to consider giving the character, and have him randomly
              shout harmless abuse (e.g. as would Looney Tunes characters) at
              the users.
            </li>
            <li>
              The product page will carry some of the zany appeal of the landing
              page, however, it must also have a formal feel, as this product is
              hoping to enter beer tasting competitions world wide.
            </li>
